        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Damir Methadzovic, a passionate up and coming Software Engineer. I'm currently a student in Brooklyn College, majoring in Computer Science. I enjoy many things, but of the many things I would say my
            main 3 are; Sports, Gaming, and Programming! </p>
        
        <h2>Here is why Programming is IMPORTANT</h2>
        <p>
            Programming is like teaching a super-smart robot to do your chores, but instead of doing the dishes, it solves real world problems, builds applications, and most important runs the internet. Programming powers our every day to day life,
            from your favorite show, to your favorite website, to life saving medical technology. Without programming, none of those would exist. Programming in my eyes, is the key to unlocking the future. Plus having this ability technically makes you a magician
            as you can make anything come to life.
        </p>
